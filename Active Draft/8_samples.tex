\chapter{Examples}
The following sections demonstrate some example embedded meta entries in various file types.

If you have an additional file type example that is missing in this section, post a minimum-demonstrating-example as an issue at \url{https://github.com/UCREL/CL-metaheaders/issues} either as a plain request, or as a pull request for this document to be merged in.

\section{Absolute Minimal Header}
This example shows the absolute minimal header embedded in a TEI XML file.
The contents of the actual TEI tag have been omitted, as they serve no purpose in demonstrating the header.

\section{Valid JSON}
\lstinputlisting{examples/json-valid.json}

\section{Valid ARFF}
This example has been truncated, as it is substantially long, and the metaheader is near the top of the file.
