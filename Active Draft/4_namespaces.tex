\chapter{Namespaces}

Namespaces extend the basic meta block with additional functionality.
Developers are encouraged to create their own namespace for their own tool(s) if none of the currently accepted namespaces listed here apply.

To petition to have your namespace officially accepted, contact should be made through raising an issue at \url{https://github.com/UCREL/CL-metaheaders/issues} with a new feature request listing the following features of the proposed new namespace:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The top-level name, as it should appear in the header
    \item Any field names that are included
    \item The current latest version, in Semantic Version\cite{semver} format
    \item The name contact details for the current maintainer
\end{enumerate}

Along with a clear description of what the namespace is used for, and any other details the submitter feels necessary.

If there is a specific tool or set of tools that uses the namespace described, details should be given of what the tool does, along with where the tool can be found, ideally as a web link to a stable address (GitHub pages are one such example, where the project URL is unlikely to change, but other sites are also acceptable).

The rest of this section is given over to concrete implementations of namespaces recognised as 'standard' by this specification.
If you are planning to propose additional namespaces be added to the specification, the \texttt{history} namespace can be viewed as a template for the format and general content of your addition.
