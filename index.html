			<h1>Meta-Headers</h1>
			<p>Working with several different tools can be a complete pain if the formats don't match up. To remidy this, we are designing a small human readable header to be included in as many file types as possible describing the file contents in a cross-platform, cross-tool way!</p>

			<h2>Paper: Corpus File Meta-Headers - An Open Standard For Corpus Meta Data</h2>
			<abstract>
				With the increasingly large variety of tools available to the modern corpus linguist, there is a pressing need to be able to efficiently and effectively move data from one tool to another with no (or minimal) loss.
				Though other standards exist for the representation of corpora at some level (such as TEI, or more general standards such as XML), these often presume a limited set of use-cases, offering a top-down restriction on the information within in order to impose reliable structure.
				These systems serve to restrict the data that can be stored in such formats, and ultimately this limits their usefulness.
				Our approach focuses on documenting common features, allowing for variation in document format.
				Such a method permits innovation whilst maintaining maximal compatibility between tools.
				Herein we demonstrate a method for representing, parsing, and using such documentation in practice.
