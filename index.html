			<h1>Meta-Headers</h1>
			<p>Working with several different tools can be a complete pain if the formats don't match up. To remidy this, we are designing a small human readable header to be included in as many file types as possible describing the file contents in a cross-platform, cross-tool way!</p>

			<!-- NOTE: Here we should link to the standard when it's ready! -->
			<p class="centerbox"><a class="pure-button" href="https://github.com/UCREL/CL-metaheaders/raw/master/Revision%201.0/CL%20Metaheaders%20-%20Open%20Standard.pdf">Take me to the (Alpha) Open Standard document!</a><br />
			<small>The standard is still in a pre-1.0 stage, but available for comment and additions</small></p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p>[general intro]</p>

			<h3>The Basics</h3>
			<p>While having a standard to define the attributes is a good thing&trade;, the standard must be simple to implement, and to that end, extremely minimal declarations can be used. A simple XML file, encoded in UTF-8 unicode would be required only to declare it's encoding and mimetype to be standards compliant.</p>
			<code>&lt;!-- meta { "encoding":"utf-8", "mime":"text/xml" } --&gt;</code>
			<p>The snippet above is a perfectly compliant line to include in a basic XML document, and as the headers are intended to be transparent to normal parsers to the files, the entire meta block is wrapped in a comment.</p>
			<p>We `hide' the headers this way to ensure backwards compatability with non-compliant parsers</p>

			<h3>Extensions</h3>
			<p>Sometimes, it may be desirable to include additional information in a header - as we, the authors, cannot possibly expect to know every possible set of data to be included in the attributes for a file, we incorporate an `extensions' mechanism into the standard, whereby unspecified fields can be included.</p>
			<p>In the following code block, we include author information with the standard fields</p>
			<code>&lt;!-- meta {
	"version":1.0,
	"encoding":"utf-8",
	"mime":"text/xml",
	"authors":{
		"John Vidler",
		"Stephen Wattam"
	}
} --&gt;</code>
			<p>In this example, the metadata is written across multiple lines - the parser ignores whitespace as much as possible, but some corpus formats only have support for single-line comments - in those cases, we are required to condense the long-form metadata into a single line. Thankfully, XML has paired open/close comment markers, so having this long-form example in a real document would be perfectly valid.</p>
			<p>One thing to be careful of when using a non-standardised extension is that <strong>the version field must be present</strong>. This is to ensure that as the standard expands, extensions that are added to the standard to not interfere with those in the file headers.</p>

			<h2>Paper: Corpus File Meta-Headers - An Open Standard For Corpus Meta Data</h2>
			<abstract>
				With the increasingly large variety of tools available to the modern corpus linguist, there is a pressing need to be able to efficiently and effectively move data from one tool to another with no (or minimal) loss.
				Though other standards exist for the representation of corpora at some level (such as TEI, or more general standards such as XML), these often presume a limited set of use-cases, offering a top-down restriction on the information within in order to impose reliable structure.
				These systems serve to restrict the data that can be stored in such formats, and ultimately this limits their usefulness.
				Our approach focuses on documenting common features, allowing for variation in document format.
				Such a method permits innovation whilst maintaining maximal compatibility between tools.
				Herein we demonstrate a method for representing, parsing, and using such documentation in practice.
