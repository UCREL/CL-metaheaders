META
====

A tool for manipulating meta headers in various file formats

Requirements
------------

'Meta' requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) be installed in your system before it can be installed and executed.

Refer to their respective sites for installation instructions for your platform.

Installation
------------

Download this directory (either via git or via zip download) then run 'npm install' in this directory to get the dependencies.

This will install locally, rather than on your system (a system-wide installer is still work-in-progress)

To execute on Mac/Linux, symlink 'meta' into /usr/local/bin, or otherwise add it to your path, then simply run 'meta' from any folder

For Windows, use the following via 'bash' or 'batch' at the command line:

$> node /path/to/meta

A system-wide solution without the prefix for Windows is work-in-progress
