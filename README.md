# CL-metaheaders
Metadata header format for computational and corpus linguistics

> With the increasingly large variety of tools available to the modern corpus linguist, there is a pressing need to be able to efficiently and effectively move data from one tool to another with no (or minimal) loss. Though other standards exist for the representation of corpora at some level (such as TEI, or more general standards such as XML), these often presume a limited set of use-cases, offering a top-down restriction on the information within in order to impose reliable structure. These systems serve to restrict the data that can be stored in such formats, and ultimately this limits their usefulness. Our approach focuses on documenting common features, allowing for variation in document format. Such a method permits innovation whilst maintaining maximal compatibility between tools. Herein we demonstrate a method for representing, parsing, and using such documentation in practice.
